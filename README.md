### ðŸ”¹ **Project Title**: Car Price Analysis through Web Scraping (Ackodrive)

### ðŸ”¹ **Description**:

In this project, I performed end-to-end car price analysis by **scraping real-time automobile data from the Ackodrive website** using Python. The objective was to gather, clean, analyze, and visualize car-related data to uncover trends and insights that could help potential buyers make informed decisions.

### ðŸ”¹ **Key Tasks & Techniques**:

* **Web Scraping**:

  * Used `BeautifulSoup` and `requests` libraries to extract structured data such as **Brand, Model, Fuel Type, Transmission, Seating Capacity, Location, and Price** from multiple pages of Ackodrive.
  * Handled dynamic content and ensured scraping followed ethical and legal boundaries.

* **Data Cleaning & Processing**:

  * Cleaned and transformed the scraped data using **pandas** (e.g., removing currency symbols, converting data types).
  * Handled missing values and duplicates.

* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:

  * Performed **univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis** to understand price distribution, popular car types, price ranges across cities, etc.
  * Used **matplotlib** and **seaborn** for data visualization.

* **Insights Discovered**:

  * Identified most common car brands and price ranges.
  * Found how factors like **fuel type, city, and seating capacity** influence car prices.

### ðŸ”¹ **Outcome**:

This project enhanced my skills in **data scraping, real-world data cleaning, and analysis**. It also helped me understand consumer car pricing trends and gave me experience working with unstructured web data.
